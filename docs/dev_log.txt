***Useful commands***

* git ssh setup (ssh not working with main, just use master)
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

*Docker compose
docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up / down
then npm run start:dev

*MongoDB
to run locally, cd C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\5.0\bin
mongod.exe
then run npm run start:dev in nest project

***Technical Interview Assignment***

- build one page form that takes url and returns shortened url
	eg localhost:3000/shorturl - show 'homepage'
	eg localhost:3000/shorturl/JYHsds - redirect

- backend endpoints ( postman testing )
	* takes long url and shortens it before returning result
	* sends request url and response url to db for storage (check if url already exists)
	* takes request url, checks if it's already shortened, and fetches long link from db
	* remove url from db
	
	schema - {
		originalUrl
		shortUrl
		linkUsage (clicks)
		timestamp
		//ip location of request?
	}
	
- 

***Additional Implementations***

* linkUsage

count the number of time redirect happens for specific url

* geo location

using geoip-lite
get IP from request (req.ip or req.connection.remoteAddress)
let location = geoip.lookup(ip);
need maxmind account

store useful info (town, country etc), time of click etc
can then display on a seperate statistics page

* custom alphabet to use for generating links
A field where user enters a string to be used as the alphabet when creating new links
Allows customers to control exactly what chars the shortened url will be created with


* custom domain path for short urls
Allow the user to set the domain for use in the short link
(would have to register said domain)

Would allow people or companies to create links tailored specifically to them
